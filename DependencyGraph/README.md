# Overview of the DependencyGraph Functionality

The DependencyGraph program is capable of creating pairs of a (dependent, dependee). Program adds pair to both a dependent and dependee list for ease of organization.
Program can add, remove pairs, replace dependent and dependee lists, get count of pairs, number of dependees in list, and check if dependent/dependee exists.
Thus the program is capable of organizing and handeling dependent variables and their dependents and dependee variables and their dependees.
